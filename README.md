How to run?
Open these files. 
Write your folder path in the code.
Ensure that you folder had .docx files only.
Install libraries i.e. python-docx, dearpygui, 
Run UI.py.
Enjoy...

Note: 
This Program is designed only for the .docx file. I will make it feasible for all the file types in near future. 
The path of the folder is hard coded. If you want to use this code just enter the path of your own foldera and it will work just fine.
